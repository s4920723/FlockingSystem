# Computing for Graphics Assignment - Flocking System
![alt tag](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/images/flocking_around_19.gif)

This is a WIP real time flocking system that uses NGL. It uses the BlankNGL boilerplate
code meaning that the camera, lighting and geomtry are set up individually on top of the BlankNGL demo.
The code uses the Phong shader taken from the SimpleNGL demo for testing purpouses.

## To do list:
* Boid rotation that matches the direction of movement.
* ~~A boudning box that limits the movement of the boids.~~
* Geomtry to replace the placeholder model (currently using the troll from ngl/VAOPrimitives).
* ~~Camera controls.~~
* ~~The ability of creating more than one boid.~~
* ~~The ability to delete boids.~~
* Boid flocking behaviours.
* The ability to place obstacles that the boids navigate around.
* ~~Tidy up code after testing boids, flocks and targets.~~

## Stretch goals:
* GUI using QTcreator's design tools.
* Custom shaders.
* Predator boids.
* Motion paths using simple GL lines.
* Flow fields.
